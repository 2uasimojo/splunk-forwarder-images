If IMAGE_URI doesn't already exist in the remote repository, build it
via the Dockerfile at DOCKERFILE_PATH, and tag & push it to IMAGE_URI.

Specify IMAGE_URI by tag, e.g.:
    quay.io/app-sre/splunk-forwarder:8.0.5-a1a6394cc5ae

# If so, returns success.
# If the image does not exist, but the query was otherwise successful, returns
